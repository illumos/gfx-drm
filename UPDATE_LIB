To upgrade libdrm:

change LIBDRM_VERS in
usr/src/common/libdrm/Makefile
usr/src/common/libdrm/Makefile.drm
LIBDRM_HASH in
usr/src/common/libdrm/Makefile

If the file extension of the file to be downloaded has changed, it must be
changed in usr/src/pkg/manifests/x11-library-libdrm.mf and LIBDRM_ARCHIVE in
usr/src/common/libdrm/Makefile must be modified accordingly.

# NOTE: if you want to contribute changes to this graphics/DRM gate,
# please use your own fork of gfx-drm.git and substitute HTTPS/URL below,
# to match your repository.

After you have setup a build environment as follows:
git clone https://github.com/illumos/gfx-drm.git
cd gfx-drm
export BLDENV=tools/bldenv
chmod 755 tools/bldenv

edit myenv.sh to suite your needs, and start the first build:
/usr/bin/env -i $BLDENV myenv.sh "cd usr/src; make install"

most likely this first build will err'out right after unpacking
the new library archive. At this stage the make target: check
is run, which checks differences of gfx-drm headers and the
new library supplied headers, these 5 headers will be checked:

drm.h drm_fourcc.h drm_mode.h drm_sarea.h i915_drm.h

To pass check target, generate patch files for these headers:
cd usr/src/common/libdrm/libdrm-2.4.<new-version>/include/drm
gdiff -u drm.h <WS>/usr/src/uts/common/drm/drm.h > /tmp/drm.h.patch
and the others as well, then apply these patches to headers
contained in usr/src/uts/common/drm and restart the build.
