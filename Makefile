# This Makefile is intentionally very simple, and should work with
# any make implementation (BSD, GNU, Sun).  Just a convenience for
# people unfamiliar with illumos-gate (ON) builds (bldenv etc).
# Customizations happen via the myenv.sh file.

# Do both debug and non-debug build in uts, in that order, so
# (a) we know the debug code builds, and (b) install non-debug.
