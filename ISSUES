Issues left over up from release 2.4.109:

1. This is just the upgrade from libdrm-2.4.75 to 2.4.109, no new functionality
   of libdrm-2.4.109 has been checked or reflected in any manifest file, this
   will be done in subsequent #PRs.

2. Implement dynamic creation of the new header file:

   - generated_static_table_fourcc.h

   into the build process of gfx-drm using Python, the regular build process
   of libdrm uses meson to build this header file. For the moment, the supplied
   header file was created using a regular meson build of the library on SPARC
   and Intel platforms to make sure there are no differences.

3. The creation of manual pages has been disabled in usr/src/man/Makefile
   for subdirectories man3 and man7, because illumos based distributions up to
   date don't include rst2man(1) command.

4. Get rid of 32bit support.
