# The "check" target will fail if any of the library headers don't
# match the kernel DRM headers.  That's intentional.  It's critical
# that these headers match or things will NOT work correctly.
#
# If these headers really need changes, you'll need to update the
# kernel headers, update the kernel driver code to do the right
# thing with those updates, and finally update the patches here
# to make the patched headers match the kernel again.  We could
# also just delete these lib copies of these headers, but then
# you would not notice changes when updating to a newer version
# of the libdrm code, and fail to make necessary updates.
